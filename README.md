Regression analysis is a powerful statistical analysis technique. A dependent variable of our interest is used to predict the values of other independent variables in a data-set.

We come across regression in an intuitive way all the time. Like predicting the weather using the data-set of the weather conditions in the past.

It uses many techniques to analyse and predict the outcome, but the emphasis is mainly on relationship between dependent variable and one or more independent variable.
